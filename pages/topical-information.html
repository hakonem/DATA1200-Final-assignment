        3. The Internet has grown into a ubiquitous infrastructure that societies all
        over the world are increasingly reliant on. To which extent and how does the
        internet have political consequences? Note down some examples and discuss with
        your colleagues. (From module 1.3)

        Here in Norway the Internet is used by government bodies, institutions, and businesses to carry out a number of important functions, such as online and mobile banking, administration of tax returns, digital identification, and advertising job vacancies. Online learning and the possibility of working from home became crucial for many during the corona pandemic, as was the ability to stay in touch with friends and family via social media. For many people the Internet is their primary source of news.<br><br>
        On a global scale, only 55% of households have Internet connection (Broom, 2020). This represents a huge number of people, disproportionately affecting developing nations. But even in rich countries such as Norway, a surprising number of people do not use or do not have access to the Internet: Recent research puts the figure at 14% (Kompetanse Norge: Over 600.000 nordmenn er ikke-digitale, 2020).<br><br>
        This research highlights a digital divide in Norway and the world: those who have access to the Internet and all the social functions it offers, and those who do not. Those unable to access the Internet miss out on information; social, educational and employment opportunities; and a number of functions designed to make life easier (e.g., the ability to file taxes online instead of filling out paper forms). They are in danger of exclusion from society unless public bodies and businesses take steps to a) provide alternative methods of accessing services and b) encourage and support the development of digital skills. Perceived inequity in education and employment could lead to higher levels of dissatisfaction with the government, which could affect elections and cause civil unrest. Policy makers may face difficult decisions about investment in infrastructure (e.g., broadband access in rural areas) and funding public services (e.g., adult training courses and computer access in libraries). Meanwhile, authoritarian governments are likely to welcome restricted access to the Internet and the freedom of speech it represents.<br>

    <h2>Assignment 1.4</h2>
    <p>

        4. Consider the statement "The person who invented the train invented the train crash." What are your thoughts about the societal responsibility of innovators? (From module 1.4)<br><br>
        It is unfair to place sole responsibility for the negative repercussions of new technologies on the shoulders of innovators when each one of us helps shape the role of technology in society. Innovators cannot be held accountable for user error or deliberate misuse; neither can they always predict how changes in societal values, demands and concerns will affect how their inventions are viewed or utilised.<br><br>
        Innovators certainly have a responsibility to consider the implications of their creations in the near future; taking steps to mitigate any negative effects should be an integral part of the development process. Innovators should be transparent about the intentions of the technology and how it will work, and they should actively encourage discussion with a range of stakeholders, using feedback to refine plans. A recent example of this process at work is Apple’s plans to use new technology to combat the spread of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) online. The proposal – an algorithm which detects CSAM in photos stored in iCloud – has attracted criticism from consumers and research groups, who fear the impact this could have on citizens’ privacy (Apple criticised for system that detects child abuse, 2021). Having listened to objections from customers and campaigners, Apple have ‘decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features’ (Wakefield, 2021). It will be interesting to see how Apple adapt the technology to address these concerns, although it could be argued that they failed to anticipate anti-freedom arguments at a time when issues of personal freedom and privacy have been under much discussion.
